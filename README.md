# LibraryManager

This responsive app allows the you to list, search, add, update, and delete books. I orginially built this app with a SQLITE database then I transfered the data to a PostgreSQL database for deployment purposes. *(Currently working out database transfer kinks..) I used JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, CSS, and the SQL ORM Sequelize to build this database manager. 

To install dependencies, use the package manager [npm]https://www.npmjs.com/:

```
npm install
```

To start a development server:

```
npm start
```
