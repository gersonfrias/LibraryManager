# LibraryManager

This responsive app allows the you to list, search, add, update, and delete books in an existing SQLite database.  I used JavaScript, Node.js, Express, Pug, CSS, and the SQL ORM Sequelize to create this database manager. 

To install dependencies, use the package manager [npm]https://www.npmjs.com/:

```
npm install
```

To start a development server:

```
npm start
```
